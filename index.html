          </header>
					<p>
           I begun my coding journey at 21. I started with teaching my self html and I instantly fell in love. After doing more research into the field of software development, I decided to apply to <em>Thinkful's Engineering Immersion Bootcamp</em>. From there I have begun learning so much more about the in's and outs of Software Engineering. Every day that I learn more code I am more excited to be a full time developer. 
					</p>
          <p> 
           I loved teaching myself html, but I know learning is 10x easier with a friend. I would love to work with other developers, so please reach out if you want to create something great together. 
          </p>
          <p>
           As much as I love coding 24/7, some of my other hobbies include: </p> 
           <!-- an unordered list to have my hobbies organized and easier to read-->
           <ul>
             <li> Hiking. </li> 
             <li> Camping. </li> 
             <li> Gaming on my Nintendo Switch. </li>
